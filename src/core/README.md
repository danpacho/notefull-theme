# **Core** 🔥

## **loader**

1.  `category`: responsible for category extraction
2.  `post`: responsible for post extraction
3.  `profile`: responsible for profile extraction

-   A set of functions that extract categories and posts from a `blog file structure` and return the processed data
-   **blog file structure**
    ```bash
    🏠 ${config.blogContentsDirectoryName}
    ┣ 📦 "content"
    ┃ ┣ 🗂 {category}
    ┃ ┃ ┃
    ┃ ┃ ┣ 🗂 "posts"
    ┃ ┃ ┃ ┣ 📔 {post}.mdx
    ┃ ┃ ┃ ┗...
    ┃ ┃ ┃
    ┃ ┃ ┗ 📔 "description.json"
    ┃ ┃
    ┣ ┗ 🗂 {category2}...
    ┃
    ┗ 📔 "profile.mdx"
    ```
    1. File name and structure **must follow above**
    2. You can modify the **`blogContentsDirectoryName`** of the `blog.config.ts` file to set the name of the blog directory name
    3. `File name` is direct routed as follows
        - File structure: `../{category}/posts/{post}.mdx`
        - Route result: **`https://DEPLOY_URL/{category}/{pagination}/{post}`**
-   `NextJs` calls these api functions from `getStaticProps` and `getStaticPaths` to build blog static data
